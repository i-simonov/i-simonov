# Ivan Simonov: Integration Developer Experience

## Background

Hello, my name is Ivan Simonov. For almost two decades, I have been involved in software development, initially as a software development student, and later as a professional ERP-level application developer.

## Integration Experience

In the past year, I have become deeply interested in software product integration. My development and support experience includes the following integration patterns, implemented on the ERP monolithic application side in 1C-Enterprise:

- Transactional Outbox
- Document Message
- Request-Reply
- Messaging Mapper
- Transactional Client
- Polling Consumer
- Messaging Gateway
- Message Endpoint
- Transactional Consumer
- Pipes-and-Filters
- Recipient List
- Point-to-Point Channel

## REST API Connectors

I have experience implementing REST API connectors for popular web engines, such as:

- OpenCart
- WordPress WooCommerce API
- avito.ru service

## SQL Expertise

I am highly proficient in writing complex SQL queries.

## Transition to Java-Based Integration Developer

Currently, I feel constrained by the narrow focus and high-level stack of the ERP platform (in my case, 1C 8.x Enterprise Platform). I have decided to switch my core programming language to Java while remaining in the application integration development sphere, aiming to become a professional Java-based integration developer.

## Technologies in Progress

At the moment, I am studying the following technologies:

- Java Core
- Spring Boot 3
- Apache Camel
- Kafka
- Transactional Messaging
- Microservice Architecture
